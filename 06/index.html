  <h1>Jeremy Keith - The design of HTML5</h1>

  <p> Everyone's talking about the benefits of HTML5 for web apps but the specification also introduces an extra layer of semantic richness to our web documents. These additions aren't wishful thinking for some far-flung future:
    you can start using them today. That's because the design principles driving HTML5 are steeped in pragmatism. Find out how important good design principles are to any project, whether it's a website, a content management system,
     or the very language that underpins the World Wide Web.
