  <h1>Lea Verou HTML Special, CSS, Day 2016 </h1>
  <p>Everyone and their cat knows HTML. Sure, we all struggle deciding what’s the most semantic element for each case, but when it comes to functionality, there’s nothing more to learn. Right? Wrong. No matter how well you think you know HTML, this talk will prove to you that there’s still more to explore. Also that you probably use too much Javascript for things that don’t need it anymore. Prepare to be surprised at how many elements, attributes, even entire HTML-based technologies exist that you’ve never learned, and how they could be useful in your projects, today.</p>
