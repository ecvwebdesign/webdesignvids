      <h3>In the early years of the web, there was a lot of variation and experimentation with where to put content on a web page. Then, it seems, we all settled into a handful of patterns and stayed there for over a decade. It wasn’t until the arrival of responsive design that new ideas for page layout started appearing. Now with new CSS properties for layout landing in browsers, we may be about to see a bigger renaissance in layout design patterns.

In this dynamic presentation captured live at An Event Apart Austin, Jen Simmons asks how we can better use the space inside the glass rectangle. What layout innovations could help users better find and focus on what they want? Join Jen for a walk through where we’ve been, where we might be going, and how we can better design for the true medium at hand. This talk features practical examples of what’s newly possible, along with access to a code repo for you to play with later.
