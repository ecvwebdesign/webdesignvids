<h1>Creative exhaust, the power of being open by default: Brad Frost at TEDxGrandviewAve</h1>

<p>Brad Frost is a web designer, speaker, writer, musician, and artist located in beautiful Pittsburgh, PA. He spends most days (and nights) creating Web experiences that look and function beautifully on the never-ending stream of connected devices. He travels all over the world speaking about Web design, and has worked with brands Nike, Tiffany, AOL, Entertainment Weekly, HP, MasterCard, L'Oreal and more. When not seated in front of a computer, he's behind a bass guitar or drum kit playing music with his lovely wife.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)</p>
